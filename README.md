# CSS Grid

Play [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) all the way through.

Then, observe our `index.html` file. It should be familiar to you from your Flexbox assignment.

This time, it's your task to:

- Group like colors.
- Stack them in a single long column, 150px in width.
- The order of colors should be as follows: red, yellow, blue.

- Your end product should look like this
![9 squates in a column](assets/sample.png)

Like our Flexbox assignment, please do this **without editing your HTML**.
